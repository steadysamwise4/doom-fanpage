            <p class ="doom-text">Meet Nathan Summers, time-traveling soldier and original leader of the mutant commando team, X-Force! The son of Cyclops and a clone of Jean Grey, Cable was raised by dissidents of Apocalypse in a far-flung future. He has limitless telepathic power and is always armed to the teeth—but his great weakness is the techno-organic virus inside of him that he must constantly contain.</p>
